NAME
       gwas-tools - perform GWAS analysis on phenotypes and genotypes

SYNOPSIS
       gwas-tools [--pheno <phenotypes.csv>] [--geno <genotypes.vcf>]
                  [--out <output_directory>] [--maf <min_maf>]
                  [--count <sample_count>] [--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       The gwas-tools command-line tool performs GWAS (Genome-Wide Association
       Study) analysis on phenotypes and genotypes. It allows you to analyze
       genetic associations and identify variants associated with traits of
       interest.

OPTIONS
       --pheno, -p <phenotypes.csv>
              Specify the CSV file containing phenotypes. The first column
              must be sample ID and the second column must be numeric
              phenotype measurements.

       --geno, -g <genotypes.vcf>
              Specify the VCF file containing genotypes.

       --out, -o <output_directory>
              Specify the output directory for storing the results.

       --maf <min_maf>
              (Optional) Specify the minimum minor allele frequency (between 0
              and 1).

       --count <sample_count>
              (Optional) Specify the number of samples to include.

       --help, -h
              Display the help message.

       --version
              Display the version information.

EXAMPLES
       Perform GWAS analysis on phenotypes and genotypes:
              gwas-tools --pheno phenotypes.csv --geno genotypes.vcf
              --out .
