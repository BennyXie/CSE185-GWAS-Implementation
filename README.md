## Usage

gwas-tools-cli is a command line tool that takes in a CSV file containing phenotypes and a VCF file containing genotypes. It will output a tab separated statistics file and plots of the results.

```bash
usage: gwas-tools-cli [-h] --pheno PHENO --geno GENO --out OUT [--maf MAF] [--mac MAC] [--version] [--debug] [--threads THREADS] [--process]

Perform GWAS analysis on phenotypes and genotypes.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --pheno PHENO, -p PHENO
                        CSV file containing phenotypes. The first column must be sample ID and the second column must be numeric phenotype measurements.
  --geno GENO, -g GENO  VCF file containing genotypes
  --out OUT, -o OUT     Output directory for results
  --maf MAF             Minimum minor allele frequency (between 0 and 1)
  --mac MAC             Minimum of minor allele count of a genotype
  --version, -v         show program's version number and exit
  --debug               Print debug messages
  --threads THREADS, -t THREADS
                        Number of threads to use
  --process             Use process instead of thread, significantly increase memory usage but may be faster
```

gwas-plots-cli is a command line tool that takes in a tab separated statistics file generated by gwas-tools-cli. It will output a manhattan plot and a QQ plot.
```bash
usage: gwas-plots-cli [-h] --input INPUT [--version] --out OUT [--manhattan] [--qq]

Plot GWAS results with calculated statistics.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input INPUT, -i INPUT
                        input file containing tab separated statistics
  --version, -v         show program's version number and exit
  --out OUT, -o OUT     Output filename for results
  --manhattan           Plot manhattan plot
  --qq                  Plot QQ plot
```
